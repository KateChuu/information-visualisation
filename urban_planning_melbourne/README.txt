To initialise the interactive dashboard, keep the GEOM90007_Group23 folder on your Desktop. Complete the R Shiny initialisation before continuing with Tableau.

R Shiny Initialisation:
1. Ensure you have the GEOM90007_Group23 folder on your Desktop.
2. Open the R_shiny_files folder.
3. Inside the folder there are 3 R scripts. Open each R file in a SEPARATE RStudio window (Not RStudio Source Editor), otherwise the Shiny visualisations in Tableau will collide.
4. Ensure you have all the libraries at the top of each file installed.
5. Click 'Run app' for each file.

Tableau Initialisation:
1. Open the Tableau packaged workbook 'GEOM90007_Group23.twbx'.
2. If the data connection is lost, edit the connection(s) for the data source to your local files. Each dashboard's data files will be under /GEOM90007_Group23/Data in the corresponding category name.
3. In case the Shiny visualisation is not loaded in Tableau, right-click to reload the dashboard and ensure the Shiny app is running.

You should now be able to see the dashboards perfectly.
